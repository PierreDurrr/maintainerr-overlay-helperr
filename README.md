# Maintainerr Overlay Helperr

**Project inspired by [Maintainerr Poster Overlay](https://gitlab.com/jakeC207/maintainerr-poster-overlay)**


This project is a helper script that works in combination with [Maintainerr](https://github.com/jorenn92/Maintainerr), adding a Netflix-style "leaving soon" overlay on top of your media. It integrates with Plex and Maintainerr to download posters, add overlay text, and upload the modified posters back to Plex. It runs periodically to ensure posters are updated with the correct information.

### Usage

#### Docker
1. Build and Run the Container

Create a **docker-compose.yml** file with the following content:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  maintainerr-overlay-helperr:
    image: pierredurrr/maintainerr-overlay-helperr:latest
    environment:
      PLEX_URL: "http://plex-server-ip:32400"
      PLEX_TOKEN: "PLEX-TOKEN"
      MAINTAINERR_URL: "http://maintainerr-ip:6246/api/collections"
      IMAGE_SAVE_PATH: "/images"
      ORIGINAL_IMAGE_PATH: "/images/originals"
      TEMP_IMAGE_PATH: "/images/temp"

      # Change the values here to customize the overlay
      FONT_PATH: "/fonts"
      FONT_COLOR: "#ffffff"
      BACK_COLOR: "#B20710"
      FONT_SIZE: "65"
      PADDING: "15"
      BACK_RADIUS: "20"
      HORIZONTAL_OFFSET: "80"
      HORIZONTAL_ALIGN: "center"
      VERTICAL_OFFSET: "40"
      VERTICAL_ALIGN: "bottom"

      BACK_WIDTH: "1500"    # Set your desired width in pixels
      BACK_HEIGHT: "100"    # Set your desired height in pixels
      DATE_FORMAT: "d MMM"    # Set your desired date format between "d MMM" or "MMM d"
      OVERLAY_TEXT: "RETIRÃ‰ LE"    # Set your desired text to display before removal date
      FONT_NAME: "Roboto-Bold"    # Font file name with .ttf extension. Fonts available from /fonts directory. Added Kometa's and PATTRMM's ones for consistency if you're already using one or both of these tools.
      ENABLE_DAY_SUFFIX: false    # Enable or disable date suffix (i.e. th from November 14th). Mainly for french people
      ENABLE_UPPERCASE: true    # Use uppercase or lowercase for date format

      LANGUAGE: "fr-FR"    # Used for date format and month abbreviation language. You can change this as needed (e.g., "fr-FR" for French), will default to en-US if not provided.

      RUN_INTERVAL: "2"    # Set the run interval to after X minutes; default is 480 minutes (8 hours) if not specified
    volumes:
      - /docker_data2/maintainerr-overlay-helper/config/images:/images
      - /docker_data2/maintainerr-overlay-helper/config/fonts:/fonts
    network_mode: "bridge"
```
2. Run the container
```yaml
docker-compose up --build
```
#### Ensure Directories Exist

- Ensure the directories specified in IMAGE_SAVE_PATH, ORIGINAL_IMAGE_PATH, and TEMP_IMAGE_PATH exist on your system.
- Ensure that the font file you are going to use is present in the mapped 'fonts' folder prior to running the script.
- The script will automatically run every RUN_INTERVAL minutes. If the interval is not specified, it defaults to 8 hours.
